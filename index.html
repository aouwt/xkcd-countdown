<p>This is available on <a href="https://github.com/munvoseli/xkcd-countdown">GitHub.</a>  There is the program I am using to automatically check for updates.</p>
<p>It looks like it started on 01-10 17:00, and will end at 01-31 15:00 UTC.  In your browser's local time, that's <span id="dateend"></span>.  I currently hypothesize that, after the first frame, it is updating every four hours, when the UTC hours are divisible by 4 (00:00, 04:00, 08:00...).  The next one should be in <span id="minsuntil"></span> minutes at <span id="datenext"></span>.</p>
